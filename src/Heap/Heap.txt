Heap mainly has 2 properties

1) Complete Binary tree (CBT)

Complete Binary tree means every level of nodes in binary tree has its full capacity on nodes except last node
and insertion in binary tree should be done from left to right
for example :
                        1
                       / \
                      2   3
                    /  \
                   4    5
you can say above tree is CBT as first 2 levels has nodes to it's full capacity and insertion on last level
is happening from left to right
