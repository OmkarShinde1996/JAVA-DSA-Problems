Heap mainly has 2 properties

1) Complete Binary tree (CBT)
=================================================
Complete Binary tree means every level of nodes in binary tree has its full capacity on nodes except last node
and insertion in binary tree should be done from left to right
for example :
                        1
                       / \
                      2   3
                    /  \
                   4    5
you can say above tree is CBT as first 2 levels has nodes to it's full capacity and insertion on last level
is happening from left to right

It is advisable that you store CBT in array so that insertion and deletion & searching will be of O(1)
time complexity
                        1
                       / \
                      2   3
                    /  \
                   4    5

Array for above CBT is {1,2,3,4,5}
formula for insertion
left node insertion = 2*i+1 = 2*index of root node +1
right node insertion = 2*i+2 = 2*index of root node +2

using above formula to insert nodes will get inserted into tree in left to right fashion
formula for getting root node for particular node is = (i-1) / 2 = (node index -1)/2 = this formula will give root
node index in array



2) Heap order property
=================================================
In Minimum Heap, Heap order property says that root priority should be minimum as compared to its children
like below
                        10
                       / \
                      40  25
                    /  \
                   50  45

In Maximum Heap, Heap order property says that root priority should be maximum as compared to its children
like below
                        50
                       / \
                      40  25
                    /  \
                   30  25

Once above 2 properties are satisfied then we can say that it is a heap data structure.
