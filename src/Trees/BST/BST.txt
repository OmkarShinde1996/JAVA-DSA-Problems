int Binary search tree (BST) for every node n
1) Everything in n's left subtree is less than n's data
2) Everything in n's right subtree is greater than n's data
Example :

               5
              / \
            3     7
           / \   /  \
          1   4 6    8

In every Balanced BST operations like insertion, deletion and searching will have Time Complexity as O(log n)

Balanced BST = (Left height - Right height) <= 1

BST types
1) AVL Trees
2) Red Black Trees
3) 2-4 Trees
