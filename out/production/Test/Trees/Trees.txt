in trees just like linked list we maintain a Node class which consist of data and an ArrayList of next node address

here we are using ArrayList to store next node address because
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
if we use Linked List we have to traverse each node to get expected node and
if we use Array we need to have predefined size of the array, hence in case of trees as we don't know the size
of the array can be and we also don't want to travel entire linked list to get expected node we are using
ArrayList. In ArrayList we don't need to define a size as it is dynamic and also we will get expected node by
providing it's index in ArrayList.
