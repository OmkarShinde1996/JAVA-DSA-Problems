Basically we use HashCode to generate the key in HashMap using which we can go and store the value on that key
position in array

There are various methods to generate HashCode
First we use Hash function to give us the integer hashed value of the string or any data type
then we pass it to compression method to give us the key between array size.
It is possible that 2 or more data may get same compressed key in that case we use collision handling

Collision Handling
1) Closed Hashing - In closed hashing 2 or more data can go on same key i.e. we can make particular array bucket
as arrayList
2)Open Addressing - In Open Addressing if the provided key by hash function is already full then we try to find
another key by using various technics like linear probing, quadratic probing etc.
